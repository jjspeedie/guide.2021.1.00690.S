#  Introduction

Jupyterbook guide to reduction and imaging of Cycle 8 ALMA program 2021.1.00690.S (PI: R. Dong).

Things to keep in mind:

- This guide is as much about the scripts as it is about the HTML content.

- What we did was for our program; what works for your program might be different.

- What we did is a function of the wisdom at the time (and the people who I got wisdom from); the wisdom is constantly changing. This is like a still image, not necessarily good forever.
