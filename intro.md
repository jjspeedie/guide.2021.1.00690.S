#  Introduction

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.

Things to keep in mind:

- This guide is as much about the scripts as it is about the HTML content

- What we did was for our program; what works for your program might be different

- What we did is a function of the wisdom at the time (and the people who I got wisdom from); the wisdom is constantly changing. This is like a still image, not necessarily good forever.
