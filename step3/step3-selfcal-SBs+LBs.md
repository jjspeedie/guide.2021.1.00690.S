# Self-Calibration of SB+LB Data

Here, we self-calibrate the long-baseline and short-baseline continuum data together (phase-aligned and concatenated).

## Summary of path through self-calibration

**Path through LB+SB self-cal.** This table portrays the path taken through self-calibration through the choice of parameters in every round. Self-cal "starts" in the third column ("Round p0") with the ``tclean`` task, and then proceeds to the fourth column ("Round p1") with the ``gaincal`` task, and so on. We performed six rounds of phase-only self-cal ("p1", "p2", "p3" etc.), and one round of amplitude+phase self-cal ("ap"). In each round, the parameters in the ``tclean``, ``gaincal`` and ``applycal`` tasks were set as listed in that round's column. In CASA, setting a parameter to ``''`` means "all" or "nothing". Rows to look at include ``solint`` (the solution interval), ``calmode`` (phase or amplitude+phase), ``combine`` (note ``'spw'`` is now always combined), and the number of failed solutions (that did not satisfy our SNR requirements). The ``threshold`` parameter for the ``tclean`` task is not set because we clean interactively.

**(selfcal_dict.txt)** The bottom few rows keep track of relevant quantities or image metrics as they change over the course of each round. Rows to look at include **SNR** (improved from 154 to 239), **disk flux** (slightly decreasing monotonically), and the beam major & minor axes **bmaj** & **bmin** (constant as data associated with failed solutions is *not* flagged out).

**Context for choice of ``solint``: Scan lengths within each execution block.** For example, the LB EB3 execution block contained 13 scans mostly 181 seconds long, though some were 121 seconds long. Thus, the ``solint`` choices of ``900s, 360s, 180s, 60s`` for the LB+SB self-cal roughly correspond to five scans, two scans, one scan, and a third of a scan in the case of the LB data. Integer multiples of 60s were chosen to be harmonious with the LB scan lengths.

`````{dropdown} Additional explanation of parameter choices that are different from the SB-only self-cal

In the ``gaincal`` task:

  * ``solint``: Previously in the SB-only self-cal, we used ``solint``s that were nice fractions of the scan lengths. This wasn't so possible for the LB+SB self-cal, because the LB scan lengths weren't as consistent. Instead, we reverted to the DSHARP/MAPS ``solint`` sequence.

  * ``combine``: This time it wasn't possible to avoid ``combine='spw'`` without sacrificing a lot of data. What constitutes "a lot" is subjective, but my sense was that there were too many printouts of flagged solutions (see the <a href="https://github.com/jjspeedie/workflow.2021.1.0690.S/blob/main/step3_continuum_selfcal.py" target="_blank">the script</a>).

  * ``refant``: Again selected using the refant lists generated by the pipeline ``hif_refant`` task, shown in the weblog. This time the antenna rankings changed between the different executions, so I calculated an "overall ranking" by multiplying the rank of each antenna in each execution and taking the four with the smallest overall rank.

  * ``minSNR``: Same as the SB-only self-cal. Perhaps it's worth noting though that DSHARP decreased the ``minSNR`` to ``1.5`` for their SB+LB self-cal.

  * **num flagged solns**: There are a lot more flagged solutions in the LB+SB self-cal than there were in the SB-only self-cal, but (!) we also have a lot more data in the SB+LB self-cal.

In the ``applycal`` task:

  * ``applymode``: Here we are trusting the wisdom of DSHARP and copying them (they switch to ``applymode='calonly'`` for the SB+LB self-cal). This applies the calibrations, but **does NOT flag the data** where no calibration solutions are found. This means we do not lose data (so our beam size does not increase), but we also bring with data that has not been calibrated. CASA warns to use this with extreme caution.

  * ``spwmap``: Since the ``gaincal`` ``combine`` includes SPW in all rounds, we need a ``spwmap`` in all rounds.

In the ``tclean`` task:

  * ``robust``: In my first SB+LB self-cal venture, I used ``robust=0.5`` as before, but there were *a lot* of flagged solutions. Ryan suggested we can play with the ``robust`` parameter. Getting high SNR is important. We can image with a lower ``robust`` later for our final images if we want. So for the self-cal, we increase ``robust`` to ``1.0``.

`````{dropdown} üêõ Error in Calibrater::solve: Mismatch between Solution frequencies and existing CalTable frequencies
I encountered this (<a href="https://github.com/e-merlin/eMERLIN_CASA_pipeline/issues/70" target="_blank">documented</a>) error in the ``gaincal`` task using CASA 6.2.1:

````
Current CalTable nchan= 1

To avoid this bug, it was necessary to switch to CASA 6.4.1 at this point in the reduction process.

## Achieved phase solutions as a function of time and antenna (the calibration tables)

All of SB EB1, SB EB2, LB EB1, LB EB2, LB EB3, LB EB4, LB EB5 and LB EB6 were self-calibrated together. The following plot shows the gain phase solutions for a single EB and a single self-cal round.

**Self-calibration solutions for LB EB1 (round "p4").**  Gain phase as a function of time. Blue shaded regions denote the target scans. The legend says "EB3" because in the combined SB+LB measurement set, the SB EBs take the index of 1 and 2 (so LB EB1 becomes SB+LB EB3). Since all SPWs are combined, points are coloured the same colour (happens to be purple).

```{note}
Message from Jess: More plots of the self-calibration solutions for the LB+SB self-cal (like shown in the movies on the previous page for the SB-only self-cal) are available upon request (jspeedie@uvic.ca). It's just quite time consuming to compile the many panels into videos (eight videos, if one for each EB).
```

## Images made after each round

The following movie shows the continuum image achieved after each round of self-cal (with a large colour bar stretch to exaggerate faint emission).

**Continuum image achieved after each round of LB+SB self-cal.** Things to notice: (1) the SNR increases; (2) the images visually improve; (3) the beam does not get bigger.

**A gif blinking between our initial image (round "p0") and our final image (round "ap").** We achieve a decrease in rms noise by a factor of 1.6. The peak intensity decreases by about 0.3 mJy/beam. The SNR improves by a factor of 1.5. The outer ring becomes more well-defined. The inner cavity appears emptier; the inner disk appears unchanged.
