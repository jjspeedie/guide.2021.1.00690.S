# Manual Flagging

There are some flaggable issues we identified during inspection of the weblog, namely bad antennas during Tsys measurements in both the SB and LB data. For example:

However, the guidance I was given is that self calibration will take care of them for us. As such, I'll neglect any manual flagging for now.
