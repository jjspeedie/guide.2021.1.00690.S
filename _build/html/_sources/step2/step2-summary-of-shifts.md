Out of interest, here are how the values of the required offsets look on the sky, in comparison to the init_cont beam of each EB. The numbers written next to each beam are [the hypotenuse of the deltaRA-deltaDec offset]/[the beam minor axis]. So the required offsets range 8-21% of a beam minor axis for the LB EBs, and 6-40% of a beam for the SB EBs. The offset for SB EB2 (yellow) was definitely noticeable in the init_cont images.
