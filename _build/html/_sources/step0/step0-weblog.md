# Inspecting the Weblog

<!-- ## ALMA-Provided Resources Specific to Our Program -->

**The weblog.** This is like the program's bible. Its importance and helpfulness cannot be emphasized enough. We have two in total; one for each of TM1 and TM2.

**Quality assurance (QA) reports**. These are like an extremely abridged version of the weblog; some information is more easily accessed here, but only a few certain aspects can't be found anywhere else. We have 10 QA reports in total: 8 QA0's for each execution block, and 2 QA2's for each of TM1 and TM2.

In the weblog or QA report, identify which version of casa was run by the pipeline.

Compare and contrast the "Science Windows" vs. all SPWs.
